We did this project to learn how to deploy machines, load balancers, set up nsg's, docker. It also helped to make some things we learned make sense. Setting up nsg's, load
balancer, and docker containers gave some real life scenarios of what ports you need to have open and how. I enjoyed the project personally because a lot of it had to do with 
networking, and it's nice to work on something that is closer to a real life example of how things would work. If I ever need to spin up a web server real quick, it should be
pretty easy now.
